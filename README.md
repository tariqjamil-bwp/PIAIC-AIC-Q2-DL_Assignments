# Q2-DL_Assignments
The flowers folder and credit cardcard.csv were too big for import.
The Flower classification would require convlutional layers that I could copy from net, but are out of scope of the Q2 syllabus chapter 1-4.

I did all the assignments on my local pc, instead of colab using graphic cards cuda cores GTX 1050
